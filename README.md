# WindowsInland
This project allows you to use Flexi Island programs made with Python tkinter modules on Windows and implement basic functionality.  
The project is still being updated and is already in beta.  
You can use QQ1625396311 to obtain the unfinished version of v1.0. We will write your name on README.md file.

# About the source code
The source code of the test version is confusing and may be difficult to understand.   
But it will be easy to read in later versions because it will format my Python code using vscode's code formatting feature.
